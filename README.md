## Python Practice

This repository is full of personal notebooks for practicing a variety of basic to advanced python problems. I created folders for the different websites providing the problems.

1. [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org)
    1. Just the very basics. By the end, we extended on some of the problems with a full object-oriented back-end and front-end gameplay for the popular games "Hangman" and "Tic-Tact-Toe."
2. [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net)
    1. Mathematics based questions with an emphasis on simple coding.
