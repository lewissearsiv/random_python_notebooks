## Python Practice

This repository is full of personal notebooks for practicing a variety of basic to advanced python problems. I created folders for the different websites providing the problems. I am particularily interested in the Project Euler section and will continue to solve the problems for fun in my free time.

1. [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net)
    1. Mathematics based questions with an emphasis on simple coding.
    2. These start easy, but some get very challenging! You have to have a little background in number theory.
    3. The goal is **not** to use grid searches. Use the theory of numbers to search efficiently.
    4. **Completed 1-50 as of 6/14/2021**
    
2. [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org)
    1. Just the very basics. By the end, we extended on some of the problems with a full object-oriented back-end and front-end gameplay for the popular games "Hangman" and "Tic-Tact-Toe."
